# Fonts for Homebrew on Linux

homebrew-linux-fonts is a Homebrew Tap which allows you to use the same friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of binary font files on your Linux.
It is a fork of [homebrew-cask-fonts](https://github.com/Caskroom/homebrew-cask-fonts), since Homebrew Casks are only for macOS.

## Prerequisites

These fonts are installable with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).
Once installed, you can configure this repo as a source for fonts.

Note that this repo differs from the upstream repository, `homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts`.
The set of fonts available may not match exactly.
Changes to upstream eventually propagate to this repo.

## Letâ€™s try it!

```bash
$ brew tap homebrew/linux-fonts          # you only have to do this once!
$ brew install font-inconsolata --HEAD
```

## Working with fontconfig

If you're using major distributions in a single-user installation, run:

```
$ ln --symbolic --no-dereference /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/fonts ~/.local/share/fonts
$ fc-cache -fv
```

For a multi-user installation, you must use `sudo` to run the commands:

```
$ sudo ln -s /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/fonts /usr/local/share/fonts/
$ sudo fc-cache -fv
```

Then you can use the new font installed by `brew`.

## Development

### Submitting a Font Cask and Bugs

This repository automatically imports new font casks from
[the upstream repository](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts/) with a bot program, so changes there
will propagate to this repository automatically eventually.

### Skipping translations by `.caskignore`

Some casks are incompatible with formula definition method.
`cask2formula` will skip translation for files listed in `.caskignore`.
`.caskignore` is written in Ruby's [`fnmatch` syntax](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.6.0/File.html#method-c-fnmatch).

## Font Licenses

This repository follows `homebrew-cask-fonts`'s policy regarding font licenses:

> homebrew-cask-fonts will only accept fonts which are freely-distributable. However, even freely-distributable fonts may have limitations (for instance, if you use them in a commercial enterprise). It is the responsibility of the user to know and respect the license of each font.
